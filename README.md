- I scraped the data using GitHub's User API with Python's `requests` library, saved it as a CSV file using Python's `csv.writer`, and analyzed it with DuckDB for its speed and efficiency in handling large datasets, outperforming Pandas with faster query execution and minimal memory usage, which allowed for more scalable and interactive analysis. 

- Surprisingly, the languages with the highest average star counts were not the most widely-used languages, revealing that developers are likely publishing only high-quality or impactful projects in languages like Cython, underscoring a trend where niche or specialized languages attract significant attention and appreciation for their uniqueness.

- An actionable recommendation for developers is to diversify their skill sets by exploring languages beyond the mainstream, as venturing into less popular languages can deepen their technical knowledge, showcase innovative project work, and open opportunities in specialized domains where demand for expertise is high.
